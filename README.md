# Bamazon

This project was created to replicate a pseudo-Amazon system in which customers can browse through items to shop for and managers can monitor inventory of products within the database.

This code utilized the npm packages of mysql for accessing and manipulating the database as well as inquirer to provide decision trees for managers and customers to work through.

The purpose behind tihs code is to be implemented for a retail store to keep track of changes to its inventory while also allowing users to take in product and (if they are managers) add to the product.
